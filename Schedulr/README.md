<h2>Schedulr, an Employee Scheduling App.</h2>

Designed for small- to medium-sized businesses, Schedulr takes the hassle out of employee scheduling.

After setting up an account, owners or managers can email sign-up links to their employees. Each employee has access to their own control panel, where they can set their availability and see their schedules.
