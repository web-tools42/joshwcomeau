Redux Voting App
================

As a learning exercise, to experiment with full-stack redux, functional programming and immutability, I'm following [this tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

It guides us through building a full-stack voting app using React and Redux on the front-end, Redux and Node on the server, Immutable.js for state, Socket.io for websocket communication, Webpack for bundling, and Mocha for testing. Fully written in ES6.
