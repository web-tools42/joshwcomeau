### A modern clone of Facebook using React and Redux.

----------

## Why?

There are surprisingly few complex, open-source examples of Redux applications. Managing relational data in a non-trivial app is not an easy task, and yet there aren't many good examples.

The main purpose of this project is to show one method of managing redux state across a large-ish application.

This repo strives to be modern. It uses:

- React Router v4
- Redux Saga
- Reselect
- Inline styles (through Aphrodite)
- Create React App, unejected (for as long as possible)
- AirBnb ESLint config

## Caveats

I do not wish to rebuild Facebook for real.

This is a front-end exercise, so all back-end data is stubbed (while still making async calls, for realism).

Facebook is massively complex, and there's no sense recreating every feature. I'm trying to include most of the "uniquely" complex areas, without stretching to include many similar variants of the same thing.

## Contribute

I would love for others to help me build this example!

Because this is meant as a teaching tool, code quality must be top-notch, follow lint rules, etc. An abundance of clear comments is necessary, with links to external resources when appropriate.
