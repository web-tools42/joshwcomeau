# Yadda

Yadda is a programming language that compiles to javascript.

It's made to read like plain English. Here are some examples:


Add 5 and 10.

> 5 + 10;

Add 2 and 8, multiply by 10.

> (2 + 8) * 10

Let "x" equal 10, and then increment by 2.
> let x = 10; x += 2;

Define a function named "sum" that takes a, b, and c:

  Let "answer" equal a plus b plus c.
  Return answer.

> function sum(a, b, c) {
>   let answer = a + b + c;
>   return answer;
> }
