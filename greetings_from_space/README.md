Greetings From Space
====================

This NASA SpaceApps hackathon project lets users send birthday or greeting cards featuring images from space. Built primarily as a learning exercise (I'm learning Backbone!), there isn't much to this app.


### To Install
Run the following commands from the terminal:

```
$ npm install           # installs our modules, mainly just Gulp
$ bower install         # installs front-end dependencies (jquery, underscore, backbone, firebase)
$ gulp                  # builds our CSS/JS, launches a webserver.
``` 

This should open a new web browser open to the app, but if not you can open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
