# RAFT
### RequestAnimationFrame Throttle

---------

An efficient manager for all your window-level event handlers. Bundles them together and uses requestAnimationFrame to ensure optimal running frequency.


### Why?

This module attempts to solve two main problems:

* Performance when dealing with lots of window-level events
* Organization, keeping code sane
