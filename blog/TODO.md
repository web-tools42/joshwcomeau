* Footnotes, some way of including optional text/links
* LiveEditableCode:
  * Allow custom resizing of split (vertical line moving)
* cancel BezierFlattener when not in viewport, since it's always re-rendering.
* work on making code theme pretty outside of JSX
* 404 page
* Size optimizations (lazy-load react-katex and its CSS?)
