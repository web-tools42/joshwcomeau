# Personal Blog â€” v1

In April 2018, I built a personal development blog focused on interactive widgets, adopting an "explorable explanation" style for blog posts.

I rebuilt the blog in early 2020 to attempt a more traditional blog format. Unfortunately, the new version is not yet open-source. I explain why in [this blog post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/why-my-blog-is-closed-source/).

I did wind up reusing many of the same components, so there might still be some worthwhile insights in this codebase!
