# Joshbot

**ðŸ¤– An artificial Discord community manager.**

This Discord bot is used in the community for the CSS for JavaScript Developers course (and, in the future, other courses I create).

It is open-sourced for educational purposes. Feel free to see how I did things. It is _not_ meant to be plug-and-play for other servers, and I do not have any documentation for it. Also: I am not looking for contributions at this time.

## Local Development

> I've moved all of my personal notes on development to Confluence! If you're authorized, you can read them here:

## Credits

This bot was _heavily_ inspired by [Kent C. Dodds' Discord bot](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-discord-bot).
