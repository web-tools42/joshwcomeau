        Hi! I'm Josh. I built Tello.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        Many nights, after work, my partner and I like to watch an hour or two
        of trashy reality TV. It's a great way to unwind after a long day.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        Finding something to watch was tricky, though. Unless we binge-watch a
        series, it's hard to remember where we left off when we return to it.
        Worse, sometimes I'd totally forget that a great show even existed;
        months after a season ends, how do you remember to check to see if there
        are new episodes?
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I tried some of the existing options but found that they were bloated
        overcomplicated. I wanted a quick, fun way to check what shows were
        available for me to watch, and nothing I found did the trick.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        As a software developer and semi-competent designer, I realized that
        this was a problem I could solve, and Tello was built!{' '}

        {/* eslint-enable jsx-a11y/accessible-emoji */}
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        This is very much a side-project. It was built mostly during a week-long
        vacation, and continues to be developed during evenings/weekends. As a
        result, the scope is very narrow. It only does 1 thing: helps you keep
        track of your favourite shows, so you can figure out really quickly what
        to watch, when you're sitting in front of a TV.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        The goal of Tello is not to become a business, or to make money. It's
        something I wanted to exist, and a good excuse to practice my design/dev
        skills. If, by some miracle, it becomes popular, I may have to introduce
        some monetization, to cover its costs. Maybe I'd charge a small
        membership fee... but if I did, I'd keep it free for my early adopters
        (that's you!). Y'all would get grandfathered into a free plan. But yeah,
        that's unlikely.
