# v0.3 - Lighting previews and performance

This is a really exciting release, because it addresses the 2 most commonly-requested features:

- Being able to preview the events/lighting you create
- Performance

Let's tackle these in turn:

#### Lighting previews

In the "Events" view, you can click the toggle in the bottom-left corner to enable background lighting:

/>

The sliders beside this toggle allow you to customize the height of each row, and how see-through the event grid is:

/>

In addition to a low-fidelity preview in the background, the **Demo view** features high-fidelity "bloomed" lighting:

/>

It's still important to test your map's lighting in-game, but you should have to do it much less often now that you can get a general sense right from the editor :D

#### Performance

Beatmapper runs entirely in the browser, and it uses a language (Javascript) never meant for this type of graphic-intensive work. As such, the performance of Beatmapper has always been worse than competing editors.

This new version introduces a "quality toggle". You can switch between low/medium/high graphics settings:

import qualityToggle from './videos/quality-toggle-2.mp4';

<video
  src={qualityToggle}
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  controls
  style={{
    width: '100%',
  }}
/>

This setting changes a few things:

- Draws fewer blocks on the screen
- No more reflections on blocks
- No fog effect
- Greatly simplified lighting
- Optimized rendering on the scrubbable waveform

There's still a lot of room for improvement, and honestly I don't expect a night/day difference... but for folks who were running at ~10-20fps before, it should hopefully help quite a bit!
