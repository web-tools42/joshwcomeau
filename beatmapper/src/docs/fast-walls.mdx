By default, walls pop into existence a few beats ahead of the player, and move at the same speed as the notes towards the player. Fast walls offer a way to tweak this behavior, and send walls shooting quickly towards the player.

> Fast walls are a very advanced feature, with many caveats.
>
> For one thing, you risk injuring players who are startled by how quickly an obstacle flies towards them!
>
> Additionally, they exploit a loophole in the game's programming, and will likely be patched in the future. Using fast walls might make your maps unplayable.

### Enabling fast walls

By default, you are not able to place fast walls.

Head into the "Map settings" page and scroll down to tick the "Enable Fast Walls" checkbox.

### Toggling fast walls

To set a wall as "fast", select it and then click the "Toggle Fast Walls" button in the right side-panel. Fast walls are differentiated with a large "F" in their center:

import fastWallsSrc from './images/fast-walls.png';

<img src={fastWallsSrc} width={600} />

### Working with fast walls

Simply toggling a wall as "fast" won't guarantee that it moves by the player quickly. The _speed_ of the wall depends on its _duration_ and _start beat offset_.

By default, notes and obstacles spawn 2 beats away from the player. If a note is to be struck on Beat 16, it spawns in the distance on beat 14. "Start beat offset" is a way to tweak that value; it defaults to 0, and you can push the offset back further with positive numbers; a "start beat offset" of 1 means that notes and obstacles start 3 beats away from the player instead of 2.

With a default "start beat offset" of 0, here's some rough guidelines:

- A wall that lasts for a single beat won't be very fast at all, it moves at a normal-ish speed.
- A wall that lasts 2 beats moves noticeably faster; Shortly after spawning it accelerates towards the player
- A wall that lasts 3 beats moves very very quickly, though it still has the same spawn animation as any other wall.

Fast walls are sort-of the Wild West; not many people understand them that deeply, and they're seldomly used. Some experimentation is required to get a feel for them.

They can provide neat effects in certain songs, especially when combined with [Mapping Extensions](/docs/mods#mapping-extensions) to place the walls outside of the player's personal space. But they carry risks: a future update might break any map that uses them! So please be cautious.

Better support might come in the future, but until their future feels more solid, it's not worth investing time into.
