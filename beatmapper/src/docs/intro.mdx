Beatmapper is a web-based editor for Beat Saber™. It lets you create your own "maps"—block choreographies—to be used in-game for your favourite songs.

**This project is no longer actively maintained.** The software hasn't been significantly updated since late 2020. It might still work, but you should definitely test everything out, _including publishing_, before you spend time working on a map.
