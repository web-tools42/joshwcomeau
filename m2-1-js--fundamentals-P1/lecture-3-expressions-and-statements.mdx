# 2.1.3 - JavaScript Expressions vs Statements

---

## Expressions

---

When you open the developer tools and enter `5 + 1`, the answer is shown below:

---

Chrome shows us the result of _evaluating an expression_.

---

We can enter a straight value:

```js
5
```

```js
"hi"
```

```js
[1, 2, 3]
```

---

Each of these values is also an expression.

But expressions can contain expressions:

```js
5 * 2
```

```js
`I have a box full of poptartsâ€”${2 * 4} poptarts!`
```

```js
1 > 2
```

```js
1 < 2 && 3 < 4 || 5
```

---

_Expressions are the language equivalent to phrases._

---

## Statements

---

- The simplest statement is an expression with a `;` after it.
- A statement expresses an action to be carried out.

---

## Expressions vs Statements

- Expressions produce a value, statements do not
- Expressions can be put anywhere a value is expected, statements have stricter rules
- Ultimately, this distinction is subtle, and it's OK for it to be fuzzy.

---

```js
console.log('Hello!');
```

```js
if (5 < 2) {
  console.log('Never going to happen!');
}
```
