# 2.1.5 JavaScript Control Flow

---

JavaScript executes a program from start to finish in order.

<img src={line} />

---

## Conditional Execution

- We will very often need a program to do things _conditionally_.

<img src={conditional} />

---

### The `if` Statement

- The `condition` must be "truthy" for the code inside of the `{}` to actually run.

```js
if (condition) {
  // do something
}
```

---

```js
let allegiance = '';
if (forceUseGood === true) {
  allegiance = 'jedi'
} else {
  allegiance = 'dark side'
}
```

---

```js
let number = 20;
if (number > 16) {
  console.log('Hold');
}
```

---

```js
let number = 20;
if (number > 16) {
  console.log('Hold');
} else {
  console.log('Hit me');
}
```

---

#### Exercise

Turn the following sentences into valid JavaScript `if` statements. _Use console.log() to "announce" an action._

```js
// 1. If it rains, I stay home.
let currentWeather = 'rainy';

// 2. If I am hungry, I eat.
let hunger = true;

// 3. If it's 10pm, I go to bed. If not, I write code.
let currentHour = 22;

```

---

## Loops

---

Here is a program that outputs all even numbers between 0 and 12.

```js
console.log(0);
console.log(2);
console.log(4);
console.log(6);
console.log(8);
console.log(10);
console.log(12);
```

This is tedious, but manageable...

---

Here is a program that outputs all even numbers between 0 and 1000.

```js
console.log(0);
console.log(2);
// ... on and on and on...
```

This is where loops come in!

---

### `while` Loops

<img src={whileLoop} />

---

#### Example

```js
let number = 0;
while (number <= 12) {
  console.log(number);
  number = number + 2;
}

// let's break that down.
```

---

Let's write a function that outputs 2^10 (two to the power of ten).

```js
// Example


```

---

`while` is a great tool for some situations, but it can sometimes be a little tedious.

We still need to

- define a counter
- define the condition for loop to run
- increment that counter, everytime the `while` loop runs

I wonder if there is a shorthand `for` this? 😉

---

### `for` Loops

<img src={forLoop} />

---

#### Example

```js
for (let number = 0; number <=12; number = number + 1) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(number);
  }
}

// let's break that down.
```

---

⚠️ The **ONLY** way to break out of the loop is for the condition to be `false`. ⚠️

---

- If you write a `for` loop that _always_ evaluates to `true`, your loop will continue forever.
- This is a bad thing... it will crash your environment (browser window, node env, etc.).
    - To fix it, you will need to force-quit the environment.

---

#### Exercise 1

Write a program that output all of the numbers from 0 to 25

```js
// code here

```

---

#### Exercise 2

Write a program that output all of ODD the numbers from 0 to 25

```js
// code here

```

---

#### Exercise 3

Write a program that output all of the numbers from 0 to 25, but replaces all multipes of `5` by the phrase `five alive!`

```js
// code here

```
