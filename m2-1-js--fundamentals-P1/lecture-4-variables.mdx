# 2.1.4 JavaScript Variables (bindings)

---

- Variables are used to hold data values.
- Variables are essentially data containers.
- They can also hold functions
- There are 3 ways to declare variables.

```js
var name = 'Rick';
const profession = 'Scientist';
let grandson = 'Morty';
```

---
## Defining variables

- Never use `var`. It really should be deprecatedâ€¦
- Use either `const` or `let`
  - `const` for variables that _will never change_
  - `let` for variables that _may change_

---

## Naming conventions

- Can be just about anything.
- Cannot contain spaces.
- Can contain numbers but cannot start with a number.

```js
// Example

```

---

### Camel Case, dashes, and underscores

For clarity, we often want to name variables with multi-word expressions.

There are many ways to do this.

- Camel Case
  - `myVariableName`
- Underscores
  - `my_variable_name`
  - `MY_VARIABLE_NAME`

---

In the course, we will be using `camelCase`.

---

### Reserved words

There are some keywords in JS which can't be used as variable names:

```js
let const = 5
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'const'
```
