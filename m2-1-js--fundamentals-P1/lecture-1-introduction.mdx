## The power of programming

---

Programming is the act of using the computer at a _lower level_.

It's not much different from using any sort of productivity software (excel, photoshop...)

But because it's more low-level, the things you can do are much more broad.

---

It is frustrating.

But also incredibly rewarding.

## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript was built in 12 days by 1 person.
- It was built in 1995, so it is relatively new.
- JavaScript is **not** the same thing as Java
- A new version of the language comes out every year (ES2019, ES2020, ...)
