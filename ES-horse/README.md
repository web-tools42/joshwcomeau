Javascript has only been around for 20 years, but it has evolved a whole lot during that time. Originally introduced in 1997


As a language, Javascript has changed a lot in its relatively short 20-year lifespan. Famously created in just 9 days by [one man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), Javascript was unleashed on the world in March of 1996 with the release of Netscape Navigator 2.0.

I decided it would be a fun project to see what it was like to program in the original, pre-ECMAscript javascript.

The app I decided to make is a simple game, where you select one of several horses to "bet" on, and they race to the finish. If your pick wins, you're the winner.

In this repo, you'll find two files: `modern.js` and `legacy.js`. I'm building the modern one first, using ES2016+ tools. Once complete, I will see how much effort it takes to get this app to run in the original Netscape Navigator 2.0, running in a Windows 95 virtual machine.
