# Utils

Helpers are abstract functions designed to help with general tasks.

Lodash functions are all `utils`, and we have functions to help with sorting and filtering.

The rule of thumb is: would these functions be useful in other, unrelated projects? If so, they ought to be considered a util. Otherwise, they should be kept in `helpers`.
