3ish years ago I got my first exposure to programming - playing around with
Python, trying to solve Project Euler math problems. For practice I made a
blackjack terminal game, and then a poker game with PyGame and a very basic
GUI.

Ever since then I've wanted to make multiplayer online scrabble. Not because
I'm in love with word-based board games, but because it seemed like a really
cool, varied project.

I never pursued it because trying to create an online game with Python seemed
like a massive pain; I couldn't even figure out how to make bundled executables
to distribute to friends, and working out the networking from scratch...
*shudder*.

Javascript is a much better platform for making board games, and Meteor makes
the 'online multiplayer' part trivial. I'm super excited that, years later,
I can finally realize this dream =)
