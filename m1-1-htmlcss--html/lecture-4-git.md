# Intro to Git

---

## What is Git?

Git is **version control software**.

It lets developers manage different versions of the code we write.

---

## The problem

<img src="./assets/versions.png" alt="A list of ever-final-sounding filenames" />

---

This is already untenable with _one file_.

Codebases have _thousands of files_.

---

Git lets you save the _current state_ of all the files.

You can create save-points, which you can "jump back to" later on.

---

Git enables teamwork.

If two developers work on the same file, Git can intelligently merge them together.

---

### The problem

Git is made by computer scientists, and it shows.

---

It's notoriously frustrating to use.

Lots of jargon.

---

This is worth putting up with, because it gives us superpowers.

# Demo time

The demo showed how to use VSCode to:

- Clone a repo from Github
- Make changes
- Select (stage) files to commit
- Create a commit
- Push that commit to Github

See the `CLI-Git-cheatsheet.md` for more information.
