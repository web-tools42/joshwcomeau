# Intro to Github

---

## What is Github?

Github is a home for your Git repositories.

---

You can _push_ your Git repository to Github, and other people can _pull_ it to get that code on their computers.

---

# Demo

Let's put our book on Github!

---

# Forking

Can we clone someone else's code? **Yes**.

We can't change their code on Github though.

---

If we want our own "proper" copy, we need to **fork it**.

Forking lets us copy someone else's code on Github, and makes us the admin of this copy.
