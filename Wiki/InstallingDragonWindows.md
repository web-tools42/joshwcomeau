### Choose your microphone.  The built-in microphone most computers have is enough to get started with, but the better micropohone you have the better your experience will be.

![Choose your microphone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163925/80395011-4303d880-8878-11ea-9b83-9dcf2b32dc92.png)

### Adjust your microphone so that either a headset microphone is at the corner of your mouth or a regular microphone is two feet straight in front of you.

![adjust your microphone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163925/80395134-662e8800-8878-11ea-9b1c-305a182e9f5d.png)

### Now we train a Dragon Dictate profile to understand you by reading text so it can analyze an accent.

### Dragon is customizing itself

![Dragon spends some time customizing itself. ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163925/80395596-0f757e00-8879-11ea-84c4-a5256d93893d.png)

### Dragon wants to collect what you say.  I like my privacy, so I tell them they can't use my transcripts as training tools.

### Dragon is now ready to use. As soon as you click next, it will open a series of tutorials.

![Dragon i](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1163925/80395977-96c2f180-8879-11ea-9ae2-039a38ef9aeb.png)

### It is useful to follow the tutorials, but it is more useful to know two things:

First, the command "what can I say" shows you what command options you have in a particular window.

Second, you can go back to the Interactive Tutorial at any time by

 - moving your mouse up to the DragonDictate bar
  - when it expands moving your mouse to hover over the help button,
  - click on the help button,
  - and choose interactive menu.
