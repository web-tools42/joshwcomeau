### So, components...

React components are typically used to render views.

Because this is how they're most often used, it's natural to think of them as super-powered template renderers. You write some markup, pass it some data via `props`, and in return you get stuff rendered to the screen.

Something I've come to realize, though, is that this "component" pattern is useful for more than just visual UI.

When you use React components, you get a lot of things "for free" - things like lifecycle hooks, internal state, and component composition.

These things wind up being very useful for a bunch of different purposes, completely unrelated to painting elements on a screen.

Let's take a look at some examples of renderless components.



### Simplest Example Possible: Logging

So that we're all on the same page, let's take a look at what I mean by "renderless components":

```jsx
import { PureComponent } from 'react';

// Using a PureComponent so that it only re-renders when its props change.
export default class Log extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    // Our render method logs whatever you pass it as children
    console.info(this.props.children);

    // It returns `null`, so that nothing is rendered to the DOM.
    return null;
  }
}
```

You'd use it like this:

```jsx
const UserProfile = ({ currentUser }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{currentUser.name}</h1>

    <Log>{currentUser}</Log>
  </div>
);
```

This is, of course, a contrived example. Even as such, though, it occurs to me that with a little extra effort, this could be genuinely useful:

```jsx
import { PureComponent } from 'react';

// Using a PureComponent so that it only re-renders when its props change.
export default class Log extends PureComponent {
  log() {
    // Calculate the owner component, so that we can find its callsite
    // (this depends on react internals and may change at any point, but this
    // has been a stable way to find parents for several years now).
    const parent = this._reactInternalInstance
      ._currentElement
      ._owner
      ._instance;

    console.group();
    console.info('data:', this.props.children);
    console.info('caller:', parent);
    console.groupEnd();
  }

  render() {
    // Only log in development environment
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      this.log();
    }

    return null;
  }
}
```

### A more interesting example

The web continues to advance and bring with it more native APIs that do awesome things. One such example is the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

The traditional way of using an API like this with React would be to call the API methods (or some lightweight wrapper over them) from within your components.

It turns out that by making _the component_ the abstraction, you get a bunch of stuff for free. Let's take a look at a `<Speak />` component:

```jsx
class Speak extends PureComponent {
  static propTypes = {
    language: PropTypes.string,
    children: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  }

  static defaultProps = {
    language: 'en',
  }

  // The SpeechSynthesis API is invoked with an 'utterance', an object that
  // holds all necessary information about the voice, language, and message.
  utterance = new window.SpeechSynthesisUtterance()

  componentDidMount() {
    // This is a quirk of the SpeechSynthesis API.
    // In order to speak, you need voices, and sometimes those voices aren't
    // ready when the component mounts.
    // By forcing an update when the voices load, we ensure any on-mount
    // message is spoken.
    window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = () => {
      this.forceUpdate()
    };
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Stop any currently-playing or queued speech from continuing
    // after this component is unmounted.
    window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
  }

  speak() {
    // This method handles the actual 'speaking', using the SpeechSynthesis
    // API. For simplicity, we grab the first voice that supports the language
    // specified in the props.
    const { language, message } = this.props;

    window.speechSynthesis.cancel();

    this.utterance.voice = window.speechSynthesis
      .getVoices()
      .find(voice => voice.lang.startsWith(language));

    this.utterance.lang = language;
    this.utterance.text = message;

    window.speechSynthesis.speak(this.utterance);
  }

  render() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

This component can be used like so:

```jsx
class DictationBox extends Component {
  state = { message: '' }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Add some text here..."
          onChange={ev => (
            this.setState({ message: ev.target.value })
          )}
        />

        <Speak message={this.state.message} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### What do we gain from this?

On first glance, you might think that this is overengineered, or an unnecessary layer of abstraction.

The thing is, most APIs have quirks, and those quirks can only be abstracted so much.

For fun, I created an ["alternate universe" version of this code](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/return-null/blob/master/presentation/alternate-universe/speak.js). It exposes a `speak` method and encapsulates the `onvoicesloaded` quirk, as well as handling interrupts.

When you want to _use_ this method, though, you have to do a lot more work than just adding `<Speak message={message} />`:

```js
class DictationBox extends Component {
  state = { message: '' }

  componentDidMount() {
    // BUILDUP
    // The Web Speech API may mount without its voices loaded, making any
    // on-mount speech fail.
    window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = () => {
      this.forceUpdate()
    };
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // TEARDOWN
    // We need to do unmount cleanup, to ensure that our queue is emptied
    // when the component is removed.
    window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // We also need to decide when to invoke the speech method. This was
    // hooked into our component lifecycle automatically, but no longer is.
    if (prevState.message !== this.state.message) {
      speak(this.state.message);
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Add some text here..."
          onChange={ev => (
            this.setState({ message: ev.target.value })
          )}
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Even though we've abstracted our `speak` method, there's still a fair bit of plumbing to connect it to our `DictationBox` component!

**We need to repeat this plumbing every time we want to use the SpeechSynthesis API.** It becomes a lot of duplicated boilerplate that can be removed by encapsulating with a component instead of a function.

### Will It Compose?

<img src="https://github.com/joshwcomeau/return-null/blob/master/assets/will-it-blend-smile.jpg" width="50%" />

As I was preparing this talk, I realized that I'd be delivering this talk in Paris. Our humble Speak component is cool, but it's not bilingual!

I started to think: what if I added the ability to translate the given message into another language? So that you can enter `Hello, Paris`, and have it output `Bonjour, Paris`.

As with so many real-world projects, the requirements have changed while building the product, and now we get to see how adaptable our solution is.

The work of fetching a translated message from the Google Translate API felt like a distinct concern from using the Web Speech API to speak a message. I didn't want to overload the Speak component with this logic.

What I needed was a `<Translate>` component. It would do some internal computation, and pass the data down into a `<Speak>` component.

There are a few ways to do this, but I went with the [`function-as-children` pattern](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9).

Here's how that looks:

```jsx
<Translate
  source="en"
  target={target}
  message={message}
>
  {translatedMessage => (
    <Speak
      language={target}
      message={translatedMessage}
    />
  )}
</Translate>
```

**Our `<Speak>` component hasn't changed**, it's just getting its data from a new source.

Here's what that `<Translate>` component looks like:

```jsx
// a lightweight wrapper over Google Translate API
import translate from '../../services/translate';

const LANGUAGES = ['en', 'fr', ...];


class Translate extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    source: PropTypes.oneOf(LANGUAGES).isRequired,
    target: PropTypes.oneOf(LANGUAGES).isRequired,
    children: PropTypes.function.isRequired,
  }

  state = {
    translatedMessage: null,
  }

  componentWillReceiveProps({ source, target, message }) {
    // NOTE: snipped some validation business, for brevity.

    translate({ source, target, message })
      .then(translatedMessage => {
        this.setState({ translatedMessage });
      });
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // We only want to re-render when the "output", our translatedMessage,
    // has changed. This prevents unnecessary re-rendering of children.
    return (
      this.state.translatedMessage !== nextState.translatedMessage
    );
  }

  render() {
    const { translatedMessage } = this.state;

    // So, this component doesn't `return null;`, so this is sorta cheating.
    // But, it's used to augment a component that does, and untimately no DOM
    // is touched by the rendering of this component.
    return this.props.children(translatedMessage);
  }
};
```

Here, we're making great use of React state and lifecycle methods to ensure that the children get rendered with the right stuff at the right time. These are tools you don't have when working with traditional functions!

Component composition is a huge benefit to using React components as the abstraction mechanism, instead of functions.



`<Tangent>`
##### Other ways of passing computed data

I chose to use the function-as-children pattern to pass data from `<Translate>` to `<Speak>` because it's the most explicit.

From the callsite, you can see exactly _how_ `<Translate>` is passing its computed data to `<Speak>`. If you prefer a more concise, implicit version, though, this can also be accomplished with `React.cloneElement`:

```jsx
  // In Translate.jsx
  render() {
    return React.cloneElement(this.props.children, {
      message: this.state.translatedMessage,
    });
  }

  // Consuming, within DictationBox:
  <Translate
    source="en"
    target={target}
    message={message}
  >
    <Speak />
  </Translate>
```

This method is more terse on the callsite, but it becomes a lot more "magical". If you aren't familiar with Translate's internal mechanism, you might assume that `Speak` doesn't take any props, when really that prop is being injected in behind-the-scenes.

You could also do this as a higher-order component:

```jsx
// translate.jsx becomes a function that returns a component
// It takes a component as an argument that will become embedded within our
// new component
const translate = ChildComponent => (
  // This function returns our Translate component, which is very similar to
  // the Translate component defined originally
  class Translate extends Component {
    // props, state, and lifecycle methods all unchanged from above.

    render() {
      // Our render method now passes the data directly to the provided
      // child component
      return (
        <ChildComponent
          message={this.state.translatedMessage}
        />
      );
    }
  }
)

// Consuming
const TranslateAndSpeak = translate(Speak);

<TranslateAndSpeak
  source="en"
  target={target}
  message={message}
/>
```

This is better than the implicit `cloneElement` solution, IMO, but it's still a step down from the function-as-children pattern. There's less magic, but it feels more complicated, and you have to dive into the `translate.js` HOC to understand it.

### But wait, there's more!

This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's possible with this pattern. Some other usecases:

- Event Handlers
- Non-DOM UI (eg. Canvas)
- Network requests
- Head stuff (eg. React Helmet)
- Anything that changes over time
- âœ¨ Anything you can imagine âœ¨

Obviously this is not the right solution for all problems, but interesting things happen when you think of components as super-powered functions.
