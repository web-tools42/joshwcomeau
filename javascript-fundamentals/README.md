# JS fundamentals

This repository contains a set of exercises to help you practice and understand JavaScript fundamentals.

## Instructions

First, fork this repository and copy the link from 'Clone or download' button

Use `git clone YOUR_FORKED_GITHUB_URL` in the terminal within the Decode folder to download and create a folder called javascript-fundamentals

Run `npm install` to install dependencies (used to run tests)

Start by working on the paper problems, then work in the src problems. You do not need to do anything with the test folder.

You will see this sort of code at the end of the src files:

```js
module.exports = { ... };
```

Leave it there, it is used to run the tests.

When you start working on the problems in the src folder, you can run tests for a specific file by going in the terminal and using this command (replace with desired folder / file):  
`npm test test/__proto__/problem1.js`

Preferred order of completion:  
proto  
anonymous-functions  
arrow-functions  
callbacks  
return  
this  
variable scoping  
syntax-errors  
conditional-operator  
HOF  
array-functions
