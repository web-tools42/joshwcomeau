What is the output of this program?

- Reference -

this (aka "the context") is a special keyword in functions, its value depends on how the function was called.

function foo() {
    console.log(this);
}

// normal function call
foo(); // this is undefined

// as object method (does not apply to arrow functions)
let obj = {bar: foo};
obj.bar(); // this refers to obj

// as object method (arrow function)
let obj = {bar: () => console.log(this)};
obj.bar(); // this is undefined

- Problem - 

function foo() {
    console.log(this.baz);
}

let obj = {bar: foo, baz: 8};
obj.bar();
