Replace the function with an anonymous function.
You will need to write a self executing function:
Put your anonymous function within parentheses to immediately evaluate it (so you can call it immediately)
Example: (function() {})(bob)

function greet(x) {
    console.log("hello " + x);
}

greet(bob);
