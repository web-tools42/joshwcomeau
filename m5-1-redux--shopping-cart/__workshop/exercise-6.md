# Exercise 6: Devtools!

The Redux Devtools are awesome. Now that your app has a few different actions, it's time to experiment with them!

Start by performing a bunch of actions (add some items, update quantities, remove items, re-add them). Then, try some of these things out:

- Jump to items in the past, notice how that change is reflected in the UI
- What happens if you skip a few actions? What happens to the current state of the UI?
- What does the "Diff" tab in the devtools tell you?
- Use the scrubber to rewind, and press the "Play" button
- Download the Redux state, refresh the page, and upload it (see the up and down arrows in the bottom row).

> NOTE: There is nothing to hand in for this exercise. This is meant as practice!
