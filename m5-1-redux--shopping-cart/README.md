# Redux Workshop - Shopping Cart

Today we'll build a shopping cart for a sticker store:

You can play with this live: http://redux-cart.surge.sh/

## Initial setup

The workshops starts us off with a basic "store listing" page. Lots of items are for sale, but nothing is wired up; there's no behaviour yet.

Please take a moment to poke at the existing components, and learn how the app is structured.
