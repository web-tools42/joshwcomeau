<h2>YoyoCollect Tool</h2>
<h4>(Shitty working title. Hopefully temporary)</h4>

Most serious yoyoers have a few dozen yoyos in their collection, and are constantly looking to expand their collection. This app will let users track their collection, through an easy 1-minute process of checking off the yoyos they own.

The MVP will be straightforward: Login with facebook/twitter or create a 2-field account (email and password), and check off the yoyos in your collection. All relevant stats for the yoyo (weight, diameter, width) will be kept on-site for easy comparison.

There are two awesome features that will make this app good:
<ul>
 <li>Data. Both at the personal level (what's the average value of a yoyo in my collection?) and in aggregate (which yoyo is most popular among users?), there is a lot of cool data visualization I have planned.</li>
 <li>Easy trading. While I won't be offering on-platform trading, users will be able to create a permalink to their collection, that they can include in their forum signature, for easier trading. The community will be able to see at a glance what yoyos a user has.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Stack.</h3>

This will be my first SPA (Single-Page Application), using Angular JS on the front-end and Rails as a back-end API. The latter will be hosted on Heroku, with the front-end being hosted on a simple shared webhost.

Ease-of-use and UI/UX will be a tremendous part of the challenge of this app. If I want a large chunk of the yoyo community to use it, it has to be effortless and enjoyable. No long, tedious forms. OAuth will help, allowing users to log in quickly with Facebook or Twitter, or maybe being able to create a list without an account.


Wish me luck!
