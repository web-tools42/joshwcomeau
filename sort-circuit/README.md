sort-circuit
============

A graphical implementation of several basic sorting algorithms, with Angular.js. 

Will demonstrate how Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort and (maybe) Merge Sort works, by accepting a list of numbers from the user, putting those numbers onto large blocks, and animating those blocks around as the algorithm works.

NOTE JUNE 2ND 2014:
    I'm actually pretty excited about this project - it could serve as a really neat educational tool for introductory algorithms. Angular.js, because of its built-in data-binding, is a wise choice of frameworks, but I'm just starting to learn it. 

    Rather than write a bunch of hacked-together ugly code, I'm taking some time off from this project to learn Angular with more traditional projects.
