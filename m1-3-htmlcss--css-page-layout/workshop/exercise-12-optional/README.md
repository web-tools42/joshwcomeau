# 1.2 - CSS: Page Layout - Workshop

## Exercise 12 - NO flexbox!

The very first exercise had us build this:

![exercise-1 goal](../../assets/ex-1-goal.png)

For fun, try and build this _without_ using flexbox. No `display: flex` allowed.

You will need to use `calc()` and `vh` units for this.

Example use: `min-height: calc(10vh + 200px);`
