# 1.3.1 - CSS Page Layout

---

## CSS Pixels

- Your monitor is divided into pixels (screen pixels).
- When you write CSS, you specify the height, width and position in `px` units.

This `px` unit is **not** a screen pixel, but a CSS pixel.

- Small laptop resolution: 1366 x 768
- "1080p" resolution: 1920 x 1080
- iPhone X screen resolution: 2436 x 1125

### Example of a Desktop site

<img src="./assets/nresp_desktop.png" />

---

The same site on a mobile device

<img src="./assets/nresp_mobile.png" />

---

## "Retina displays"

Apple's fancy branding term

Every "normal" pixel is made up of 4 pixels.

---

## A Quick Fix?

Add the following to your HTML page(s)

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`

This will make the CSS pixels scale on mobile devices.

## Responsive Web Design

---

Websites shift content around depending on the screen size.

## Mobile-first

In design, it is recommended to _start with the mobile size_.

It's easier to add stuff for larger screens than to take away stuff on smaller screens.

## So how do we implement these things?

## [Media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) ðŸ¥³

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (landscape or portrait)
- resolution
