title: Deploying and Hosting

Getting your shiny new Gatsby site deployed and accessible is probably the first thing you will want to do now that it's built! Also, give yourself a pat on the back real quick for creating something so great!

When you build your Gatsby application, the output is static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. This content is incredibly easy and affordable to host with any provider. We have several guides below for hosting with particular providers, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Whether you're deploying to AWS, Netlify, or something else entirely switching to static content makes deploying a trivial concern.

The Gatsby blog also has posts on both [deployment](/blog/tags/deployment/) and [hosting](/blog/tags/hosting/).
