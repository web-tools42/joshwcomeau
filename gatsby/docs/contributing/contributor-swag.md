title: Free Swag for Gatsby Contributors!
---

Gatsby relies on contributors from the open source community, and we want to make sure you know how much it means to us that you’re willing to put time and effort into [contributing to Gatsby](/contributing/how-to-contribute/).

To show our appreciation, _**everyone who contributes to Gatsby is eligible to receive free swag!**_

### How to claim your free swag

If you contribute to the Gatsby organization on GitHub, you can claim your swag by [logging into the Gatsby Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/) and requesting a discount code. With five or more contributions, you can claim your _**Level 2**_ swag.

If you’ve contributed in other ways, such as giving talks about Gatsby, teaching others to use it, writing Gatsby articles/tutorials, participating in a Gatsby research project, or any other way, please email <mailto:marketing@gatsbyjs.com> or [tweet at Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to claim your swag.
