# Redux VCR - Demo

### A very simple demo, used in the development of other ReduxVCR modules

When working on ReduxVCR's core modules, it is necessary to be able to view how all the modules work together in a real application. This demo application, while incredibly straightforward and simple, provides a good base for testing various ReduxVCR features.

It isn't really meant as an example for integration. For that, we've created a [TodoMVC repo](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr-todomvc) that showcases several different integration patterns:

- [Quickstart](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr-todomvc/pull/1)
- [Production-ready](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr-todomvc/pull/2)
- [Quickstart without authentication](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr-todomvc/pull/3)
- [Quickstart with initial cassette load](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr-todomvc/pull/4)
